## About

The Periodic Table of Office 365 is a brainchild of Matt Wade, an American Office 365 consultant, and was originally published as a flat graphic in PNG format (how it was made).

With the expert help of Niels Gregers Johansen, a Danish multidisciplinary collaboration tools geek, we now present a dynamic, web-based version that you can easily access on almost any device, and embed locally on your website, intranet, blog, etc.

## Ideas?​
We are eager to make this the go-to tool for easily explaining Office 365 to anybody. Quickly understand what Office 365 is, which apps are included, how those apps relate, and which app does what. It should also help in figuring out when to use what. You can even embed the page into your website or intranet as an always-available, constantly up-to-date resource.
