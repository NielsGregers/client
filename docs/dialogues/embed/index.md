## Embedding in SharePoint Online?

Remember to check HTML Field Security settings

Specify whether contributors can insert external iframes in Embed web parts on pages in this site. Iframes are commonly used on Web pages to show dynamic content from other web sites, like directions from a mapping site, or a video from a video site.

When using the list of allowed domains, note that all subdomains of the allowed domains are automatically trusted.

These settings do not affect content placed in HTML Fields and Script Editor web parts. Users are permitted to insert iframes from default safe domains into HTML Fields and Script Editor web parts.
