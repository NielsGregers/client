title: Which Tool When module
---
The "which tool when" module is inspired by original work of [Martin Bo Hermansen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinbh/) from [Samaqua](https://www.samaqua.dk/) who developeed an Excel format at illustrated in the figure "Hvilken opgave?" - danish for "Which task" or "Which to when".

If you have to do with user interface where the is an unbalance between what you see and what is important, the user will not discover everything. So based on Marin's work, we have tried to transform that into a format which makes is possible to keep everything on the same page. Instead of listing tasks and tools and having the intersection indicate the relevance and fit, we go for a list of task, then a column indicating relevance, where the intersection compromosis the tools which fits.




| Area | Task | 5 (best) | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 (worst) | da | ja |
